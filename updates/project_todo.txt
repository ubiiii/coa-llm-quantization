PROGRESS TRACKING:
Phase 1: [XXX] 3/3 tasks complete (100%) ✓ COMPLETED by Sami
Phase 2: [XXX] 3/11 tasks complete (27%) ✓ PARTIALLY COMPLETED by Sami  
Phase 3: [XX ] 2/10 tasks complete (20%) ✓ PARTIALLY COMPLETED by Sami
Phase 4: [   ] 0/5 tasks complete (0%) ❌ PENDING
Phase 5: [   ] 0/10 tasks complete (0%) ❌ PENDING
Overall: [XX ] 8/41 tasks complete (20%) ✓ GOOD PROGRESS!

COMPLETED BY SAMI:
✅ Research & Planning (100%)
✅ Environment Setup (Partial - 27%)
✅ Baseline Experiments (FP16: 34.53 tokens/s)
✅ 4-bit Quantization (157.11 tokens/s, 4.55x speedup!)

STILL NEEDED:
❌ INT8 Quantization (8-bit)
❌ Hardware Profiling (tensor core analysis)
❌ Visualization (graphs/charts)
❌ Analysis & Discussion
❌ Report Writing & Presentation

RISK MITIGATION PLANS:
1. GPU Access Failure → Use Google Colab (Plan B) or Kaggle (Plan C)
2. Experiment Takes Too Long → Reduce number of test prompts
3. 4-bit Quantization Fails → Focus on FP32/INT8 comparison only
4. Time Running Out → Mark optional tasks (Task 3.9) as skipped
5. Member Unavailable → Clear task ownership allows independent work

NOTES:
- Mark tasks with [X] when completed
- Update [~] for tasks in progress
- Update [!] for blocked tasks with reason
- Update progress tracking percentages weekly
- Commit code to Git after every task completion
- Tag releases at each milestone gate
- Update assignees if responsibilities change
- Add notes under each subtask as needed
- Celebrate milestones! 🎉
