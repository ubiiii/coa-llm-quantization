PROGRESS TRACKING:
Phase 0: [XXX] 3/3 tasks complete (100%) ✓ COMPLETED by Utkarsh
Phase 1: [XXX] 5/5 tasks complete (100%) ✓ COMPLETED by Utkarsh
Phase 2: [XXX] 11/11 tasks complete (100%) ✓ COMPLETED by Utkarsh & Sami
Phase 3: [XXX] 9/10 tasks complete (90%) ✓ COMPLETED by Utkarsh & Sami (Task 3.9 optional)
Phase 4: [   ] 0/5 tasks complete (0%) ❌ PENDING
Phase 5: [   ] 0/10 tasks complete (0%) ❌ PENDING
Overall: [XXX] 28/44 tasks complete (64%) ✓ EXCELLENT PROGRESS!

COMPLETED EXPERIMENTS:
✅ Phase 0: Project Setup (GitHub, risk assessment) - Utkarsh
✅ Phase 1: Research & Planning (100%) - Utkarsh
✅ Phase 2: Environment Setup (100%) - Utkarsh & Sami
✅ Phase 3: Experiments (90%) - Utkarsh & Sami
  ✅ FP16 Baseline (DialoGPT: 28.42 tokens/s, TinyLlama: 34.53 tokens/s)
  ✅ INT8 Quantization (5.58 tokens/s - quantization overhead demonstrated)
  ✅ INT4 Quantization (Llama: 157.11 tokens/s, 4.55× speedup!)
  ✅ Hardware Profiling (GPU utilization, tensor core analysis)
  ✅ Visualization (comprehensive performance dashboard)

STILL NEEDED:
❌ Analysis & Discussion (Phase 4)
❌ Report Writing & Presentation (Phase 5)

RISK MITIGATION PLANS:
1. GPU Access Failure → Use Google Colab (Plan B) or Kaggle (Plan C)
2. Experiment Takes Too Long → Reduce number of test prompts
3. 4-bit Quantization Fails → Focus on FP32/INT8 comparison only
4. Time Running Out → Mark optional tasks (Task 3.9) as skipped
5. Member Unavailable → Clear task ownership allows independent work

NOTES:
- Mark tasks with [X] when completed
- Update [~] for tasks in progress
- Update [!] for blocked tasks with reason
- Update progress tracking percentages weekly
- Commit code to Git after every task completion
- Tag releases at each milestone gate
- Update assignees if responsibilities change
- Add notes under each subtask as needed
- Celebrate milestones! 🎉
