## Introduction to Quantization

### What is Quantization?

Quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of neural network parameters (weights) and activations from high-precision floating-point numbers (typically FP32 or FP16) to lower-precision integers (typically INT8, INT4, or even INT1).

### Why Quantization Matters

1. **Memory Reduction**: Reduces model size and memory footprint
2. **Speed Improvement**: Enables faster inference on specialized hardware
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Lower power consumption for mobile/edge deployment
4. **Cost Reduction**: Enables deployment on less powerful hardware

### Quantization Types

#### 1. **Weight Quantization**
- Reduces storage requirements
- Relatively easy to implement
- Minimal accuracy impact

#### 2. **Activation Quantization**
- Reduces computation precision
- More challenging due to dynamic ranges
- Significant impact on accuracy

#### 3. **Dynamic vs Static Quantization**
- **Dynamic**: Quantization parameters calculated at runtime
- **Static**: Quantization parameters determined during calibration

## INT8/INT4 Quantization Basics

### INT8 Quantization

#### **Range and Precision**
- **Value Range**: -128 to +127 (signed) or 0 to 255 (unsigned)
- **Bit Width**: 8 bits
- **Memory Reduction**: 4× compared to FP32, 2× compared to FP16

#### **Mathematical Representation**
```
Quantized Value = Round((Original Value - Zero Point) / Scale)
Original Value ≈ Quantized Value × Scale + Zero Point
```

Where:
- **Scale**: Step size between quantized values
- **Zero Point**: Quantized value representing real zero
- **Round**: Rounding to nearest integer

#### **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Quantization**
- **Symmetric**: Zero point = 0, simpler but less flexible
- **Asymmetric**: Zero point ≠ 0, more accurate but complex

### INT4 Quantization

#### **Range and Precision**
- **Value Range**: -8 to +7 (signed) or 0 to 15 (unsigned)
- **Bit Width**: 4 bits
- **Memory Reduction**: 8× compared to FP32, 4× compared to FP16

#### **Challenges with INT4**
- **Limited Precision**: Only 16 possible values
- **Accuracy Degradation**: Significant precision loss
- **Hardware Support**: Requires specialized hardware

### Quantization Granularity

#### **Per-Tensor Quantization**
- Single scale and zero-point for entire tensor
- Simple but less accurate
- Hardware-friendly

#### **Per-Channel Quantization**
- Separate scale and zero-point for each channel
- More accurate but complex
- Better for convolutional layers

#### **Per-Group Quantization**
- Groups of channels share quantization parameters
- Balance between accuracy and complexity

## PTQ vs QAT Approaches

### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)

#### **Definition**
Quantization applied after model training is complete, without retraining or fine-tuning.

#### **Process**
1. **Calibration**: Run representative data through model

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

#### **Definition**
Training process that simulates quantization during training to minimize accuracy loss.

#### **Process**
1. **Fake Quantization**: Simulate quantization in forward pass
2. **Gradient Computation**: Compute gradients with fake quantization
3. **Weight Updates**: Update weights normally
4. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt model to quantization effects

#### **Advantages**
- **Better Accuracy**: Minimizes quantization errors
- **Optimization**: Model adapts to quantization
- **Flexibility**: Can optimize for specific hardware

#### **Disadvantages**

### Comparison: PTQ vs QAT

| Aspect | PTQ | QAT |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Implementation** | Simple | Complex |
| **Training Time** | None | Additional required |
| **Accuracy** | Lower | Higher |
| **Deployment Speed** | Fast | Slower |

## Conclusion

Quantization is a powerful technique for optimizing neural network inference, but its effectiveness depends heavily on the interplay between model characteristics, hardware capabilities, and implementation choices. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for successful hardware/software co-design in LLM deployment.

The key insight from our literature review and experiments is that **quantization benefits are not universal** - they depend on:
- **Model size** (larger models benefit more)
- **Hardware architecture** (newer GPUs with better INT8 support)
- **Implementation quality** (proper calibration and optimization)
- **Use case requirements** (accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs)

This foundation provides the theoretical basis for our experimental work and guides our hardware/software co-design approach.
