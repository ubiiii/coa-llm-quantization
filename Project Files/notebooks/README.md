# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab experiments for the LLM Quantization project.

## Contents

- **Baseline experiments**: FP16/FP32 model inference benchmarks
- **Quantization experiments**: INT8, INT4, and mixed-precision quantization tests
- **Hardware profiling**: GPU utilization and performance analysis notebooks
- **Visualization**: Result visualization and comparison charts

## Naming Convention

- `baseline_*.ipynb`: Baseline model experiments
- `quantization_*.ipynb`: Quantization experiments
- `profiling_*.ipynb`: Hardware profiling experiments
- `analysis_*.ipynb`: Result analysis and visualization

## Usage

All notebooks should be self-contained and include:
1. Environment setup and dependencies
2. Clear documentation of experiments
3. Result summaries and visualizations
4. Links to saved results in `/results` directory

## Team Access

Both team members (Utkarsh & Sami) have read/write access to this directory.
