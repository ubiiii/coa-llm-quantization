  ✅ ONNX Runtime Hardware-Assisted Inference (Task 3.9 - 50% size reduction, 1.69× speedup with KV cache)
✅ Phase 4: Analysis & Discussion (100%)
  ✅ Hardware Feature Analysis (Tesla T4 tensor core impact, SIMD utilization, memory bandwidth)
  ✅ Trade-off Analysis (accuracy vs efficiency, optimal precision identification)
  ✅ Key Takeaways (5 key insights, practical recommendations, future work)
  ✅ Peer Review (technical accuracy validation, document consistency)
  ✅ Phase Summary (comprehensive analysis documentation)

STILL NEEDED:
✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETE - PROJECT FINISHED!

RISK MITIGATION PLANS:
1. GPU Access Failure → Use Google Colab (Plan B) or Kaggle (Plan C)
2. Experiment Takes Too Long → Reduce number of test prompts
3. 4-bit Quantization Fails → Focus on FP32/INT8 comparison only
4. Time Running Out → Mark optional tasks (Task 3.9) as skipped
5. Member Unavailable → Clear task ownership allows independent work

NOTES:
- ✅ All critical phases completed (Phase 0-5: 100% complete)
- ✅ All major issues resolved and documented
- ✅ Final presentation completed and uploaded to GitHub
- ✅ Research paper completed and uploaded
- ✅ All documentation updated and organized
- 🎉 PROJECT FULLY COMPLETE! All deliverables submitted!
